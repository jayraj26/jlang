# Welcome to jlang!

A Simple Toy REPL. Jlang is a lightweight, command-line based REPL designed for educational purposes and casual experimentation. It supports basic arithmetic operations, comparisons, conditional statements, loops, and functions with variable assignment.

This REPL is intentionally kept simple and is not intended for production use or complex applications. It serves as an educational tool and a playground for learning fundamental programming concepts.

# What it has

The REPL does not provide much but provided basic operations and assignments expected.

- Command-line interface
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /)
- Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Loops (while, for)
- Functions with variable assignment
- List to hold values of heterogeneous data types(1,"hello",etc)
- Simple syntax for easy understanding and quick prototyping

## Syntax

Here is a basic syntax for looking into the REPL and its working.

| Operation                 | Syntax                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Add +                     | number + number                                   |
| Minus -                   | number - number                                   |
| Divide /                  | number / number                                   |
| Power ^                   | number ^ number                                   |
| Multiply \*               | number \* number                                  |
| Greater than >            | number > number                                   |
| Less than <               | number < number                                   |
| Equals to ==              | number == number                                  |
| Greater than Equals to >= | number >= number                                  |
| Less than Equals to <=    | number <= number                                  |
| Not Equals to !=          | number != number                                  |
| Unary operator +          | +number                                           |
| Var assignment            | var identifier = value                            |
| IF Conditional            | IF condition THEN value                           |
| ELIF Conditional          | IF condition THEN value ELIF condition THEN value |
| ELSE Conditional          | IF condition THEN value ELSE value                |
| FOR LOOP                  | FOR i = 0 TO 10 THEN i                            |
| FOR LOOP with step        | FOR i = 0 TO 10 STEP 2 THEN i                     |
